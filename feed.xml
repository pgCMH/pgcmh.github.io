&lt;h2 id=&quot;topic&quot;&gt;Topic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first meeting of 2018, we’re going with a free-form, audience participation Q&amp;amp;A type event. You’ve got PostgreSQL-related questions, we’ve got PostgreSQL-related answers. So bring your questions (and thinking caps) and let’s see if we can’t get some answers for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parking&quot;&gt;Parking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please park at a meter on the street or in the parking garage (see below). &lt;strong&gt;You can safely ignore any sign saying to not park in the garage as long as it’s after 17:30 when you arrive.&lt;/strong&gt; Park on the first level in any space that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; marked ‘24 hour reserved’. Once parked, take the elevator to the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; floor to reach the Miranova lobby.&lt;/p&gt;

We’ll talk about the key features in this release, some enhancements to existing features, and the backwards-incompatible changes that were made. This looks to be a &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt; release, so you’ll want to start looking at and testing it sooner rather than later!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inaugural PGConf US Local: Ohio Conference (PGConf Ohio) will be held September 29th - 30th at the Hyatt Regency Columbus Ohio (350 North High Street Columbus, Ohio, USA, 43215).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This two day, single track conference is a perfect opportunity for users, developers, business analysts, and enthusiasts from Ohio to amplify Postgres and participate in the Postgres community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday’s sessions are paid training classes taught be core PostgreSQL devs, while Saturday’s sessions feature topics and guest speakers from around the community. You can read all about the talks &lt;a href=&quot;https://pgconf.us/conferences/Ohio2017/schedule/events&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;topic&quot;&gt;Topic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/philvacca&quot;&gt;Phil Vacca&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchydata.com&quot;&gt;Crunchy Data&lt;/a&gt; fame, joins us this month to talk about containerized PostgreSQL!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Containerization has captured the interest of developers, engineers, and business people everywhere. While BSD Jails and cgroups are established technologies in the open source world, it is the Docker project that has grabbed recent attention. Terms like stateless applications and microservices are now almost as ubiquitous as cloud computing, or virtualization before it. It is natural to wonder what, if anything, Docker offers to PostgreSQL deployment and administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Crunchy Data Solutions has built one of the best recognized Open Source PostgreSQL on Docker suites (https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers), containing everything you need to run a PostgreSQL database solution - complete with replication, backups, failover, and appropriate monitoring - on Docker, Kubernetes, or OpenShift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No specific knowledge of Docker containers is assumed for this talk. We will briefly discuss where the technology comes from, and how to get up and running with Docker; before diving into the really gory bits like how a Dockerfile is written, and where all the data is actually stored. Before we’re through we’ll see how quickly new nodes can be brought online with containers and streaming replication, and we’ll see what we can learn about failover from other highly distributed systems. We’ll even talk through logging and monitoring strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lastly we’ll discuss what all of this work really does for us as technologists. We’ll get an overview of the many Platform as a Service offerings that leverage containers, and try to predict some things about where application and data center design are going. Hopefully, containerization inspires us to explore the ever growing feature set of our favorite database, PostgreSQL, in new and different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phil is a Senior Software Engineer at Crunchy Data Solutions where he works alongside leading PostgreSQL experts on a wide variety of research and development topics. He is interested in combining a DevOps philosophy with database administration, and has spoken on topics including Postgres on Docker and Full Text Search in Postgres at national PG conferences. Phil can be found extolling the virtues of the world’s most advanced open source database as a member of pgMKE: the Milwaukee Postgres User’s Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhunley/&quot;&gt;Doug&lt;/a&gt; will be presenting this month. He’s going to tell us all about connection pooling using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pgbouncer.github.io/&quot;&gt;pgBouncer&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll discuss why and when you’d want to pool your db connections, the different pooling modes that pgBouncer offers, and a handful of tips/tricks that you can use with pgBouncer to make your life easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parking&quot;&gt;Parking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please park at a meter on the street or in the parking garage (see below). &lt;strong&gt;You can safely ignore any sign saying to not park in the garage as long as it’s after 17:30 when you arrive.&lt;/strong&gt; Park on the first level in any space that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; marked ‘24 hour reserved’. Once parked, take the elevator to the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; floor to reach the Miranova lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
