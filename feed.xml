Once again, we will be holding the meeting in the community space at CoverMyMeds. Please RSVP on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/postgresCMH/events/237322157/&quot;&gt;MeetUp&lt;/a&gt; so we have an idea on the amount of food needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;topic&quot;&gt;Topic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/philvacca&quot;&gt;Phil Vacca&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchydata.com&quot;&gt;Crunchy Data&lt;/a&gt; fame, joins us this month to talk about containerized PostgreSQL!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Containerization has captured the interest of developers, engineers, and business people everywhere. While BSD Jails and cgroups are established technologies in the open source world, it is the Docker project that has grabbed recent attention. Terms like stateless applications and microservices are now almost as ubiquitous as cloud computing, or virtualization before it. It is natural to wonder what, if anything, Docker offers to PostgreSQL deployment and administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Crunchy Data Solutions has built one of the best recognized Open Source PostgreSQL on Docker suites (https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers), containing everything you need to run a PostgreSQL database solution - complete with replication, backups, failover, and appropriate monitoring - on Docker, Kubernetes, or OpenShift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No specific knowledge of Docker containers is assumed for this talk. We will briefly discuss where the technology comes from, and how to get up and running with Docker; before diving into the really gory bits like how a Dockerfile is written, and where all the data is actually stored. Before we’re through we’ll see how quickly new nodes can be brought online with containers and streaming replication, and we’ll see what we can learn about failover from other highly distributed systems. We’ll even talk through logging and monitoring strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lastly we’ll discuss what all of this work really does for us as technologists. We’ll get an overview of the many Platform as a Service offerings that leverage containers, and try to predict some things about where application and data center design are going. Hopefully, containerization inspires us to explore the ever growing feature set of our favorite database, PostgreSQL, in new and different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phil is a Senior Software Engineer at Crunchy Data Solutions where he works alongside leading PostgreSQL experts on a wide variety of research and development topics. He is interested in combining a DevOps philosophy with database administration, and has spoken on topics including Postgres on Docker and Full Text Search in Postgres at national PG conferences. Phil can be found extolling the virtues of the world’s most advanced open source database as a member of pgMKE: the Milwaukee Postgres User’s Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parking&quot;&gt;Parking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please park at a meter on the street or in the parking garage (see below). &lt;strong&gt;You can safely ignore any sign saying to not park in the garage as long as it’s after 17:30 when you arrive.&lt;/strong&gt; Park on the first level in any space that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; marked ‘24 hour reserved’. Once parked, take the elevator to the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; floor to reach the Miranova lobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elevator bank is in the back of the building. Take a left and walk down the hall until you see the elevator bank on your right. Grab an elevator up to the 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; floor. Once you exit the elevator, look to your left and right. One side will have visible cubicles, the other won’t. Head to the side &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; cubicles. You’re now in the community space. The kitchen is to your right (grab yourself a drink) and the meeting will be held to your left.

We had an attendance of 10 members (out of 16 that had RSVP’d) and the meeting lasted slightly longer than the hour that was planned. Everyone present had a chance to introduce themselves to the group, explain their PostgreSQL “comfort level”, and provide feedback into what they hoped to gain from the group. In all, it was a very productive meeting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pgCMH looks forward to seeing everyone again next month, on Feb 28!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Douglas Hunley</name><email>doug.hunley@gmail.com</email></author><category term="pgcmh" /><category term="postgresql" /><summary type="html">pgCMH held its first ever meeting last nite at CoverMyMeds in downtown Columbus.

&lt;p&gt;At this first meeting, we’ll be discussing what you, the members, would like to get from the meetings, we’ll talk about future topics, and general organizational things. I know it’s not exciting, but I need everyone’s input to make this group something you get value from.&lt;/p&gt;
