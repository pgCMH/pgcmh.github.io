<p>The March meeting will be held at 18:00 EST on Tues, the 28<sup>th</sup>. Once again, we will be holding the meeting in the community space at CoverMyMeds. Please RSVP on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/postgresCMH/events/237322157/">MeetUp</a> so we have an idea on the amount of food needed.</p>

<p>####Topic</p>

<p>The topic of this meeting will be an introduction to streaming replication in PostgreSQL. We’ll walk through what it is, why it’s useful, how it works, and we’ll set it up live so you can see the whole process.</p>

<p>This is the first in our series of ‘intro’ topics.</p>

<p>####Parking</p>

<p>Please park at a meter on the street or in the parking garage (see below). You can safely ignore any sign saying to not park in the garage as long as it’s after 17:00 when you arrive. Park on the first level in any space that is <em>not</em> marked ‘24 hour reserved’. Once parked, take the elevator to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor to reach the Miranova lobby.</p>

<p>####Finding us</p>

<p>The elevator bank is in the back of the building. Take a left and walk down the hall until you see the elevator bank on your right. Grab an elevator up to the 11<sup>th</sup> floor. Once you exit the elevator, look to your left and right. One side will have visible cubicles, the other won’t. Head to the side <em>without</em> cubicles. You’re now in the community space. The kitchen is to your right (grab yourself a drink) and the meeting will be held to your left. Walk down the room towards the stage.</p>
